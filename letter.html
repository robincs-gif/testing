    <p>I am really glad that I met someone like you. You are such an amazing, ambitious, beautiful, hard-working, girl. A thousand words is not enough to describe who you are and how you are as a person.</p>

    <p>For that, I want to say that I am forever grateful to you. I really really genuinely appreciate you.</p>

    <p>All the times you were there for me, I will forever cherish those memories. I want to be there for you too</p>
    <p>There may be times when the world is dark and dim; but , I know you will stand strong above it all. Just know that I will forever root for you.</P>

        <p class="song-message">I picked this song because, after you told me this was one of your favorite songs from Rivermaya, I started listening to it more </p>
        <p>and it easily became my one of my favorites. There is so much more to the lyrics if you listen carefully to it, and that's why I really like this song</p>
